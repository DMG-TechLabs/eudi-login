# Scalability

## Introduction

This section will provide the possible ways to scale this application.

## Possible solutions

Some of the possible solutions to scale this application are:

### Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling involves adding more resources to a single machine to handle increased traffic.

### Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to the cluster to handle increased traffic.

One way to achieve horizontal scaling is by using a load balancer.
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.
Another way to achieve vertical scaling is by using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.
Kubernetes provides a way to manage and deploy containerized applications across multiple nodes in a cluster by running multiple
replicas of your application and using a load balancer.
